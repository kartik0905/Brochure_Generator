      "I think this misses the point entirely.\n",
      "I’ve been teaching my son Sebastian to program since he was 7. Not because I expect him to compete with AI writing code, but because programming rewires how you think. It teaches you that precision matters. That what you say is what happens. There’s no room for “well, I meant something else.” That clarity of thought transfers everywhere.\n",
